# flux
A fast, lightweight tweening library for Lua.

## Installation
The [flux.lua](flux.lua?raw=1) file should be dropped into an existing project
and required by it.
```lua
flux = require "flux"
``` 
The `flux.update()` function should be called at the start of each frame. As
its only argument It should be given the time in seconds that has passed since
the last call.
```lua
flux.update(deltatime)
```

## Usage
Any number of numerical values in a table can be tweened simultaneously. Tweens
are started by using the `flux.to()` function. This function requires 3
arguments:
* `obj` The object which contains the variables to tween
* `time` The amount of time the tween should take to complete
* `vars` A table where the keys correspond to the keys in `obj` which should be
  tweened, and their values correspond to the destination
```lua
-- Moves the ball object to the position 200, 300 over 4 seconds
flux.to(ball, 4, { x = 200, y = 300 })
```
If you try to tween a variable which is already being tweened, the original
tween stops tweening the variable and the new tween begins from the current
value.

### Additional options
Additional options when creating a tween can be set through the use of chained
functions provided by the tween object which `flux.to()` returns.
```lua
flux.to(t, 4, { x = 10 }):ease("linear"):delay(1)
```

#### :ease(type)
The easing type which should be used by the tween; `type` should be a string
containing the name of the easing to be used. The library provides the
following easing types:

  `linear`
  `quadin`       `quadout`       `quadinout`
  `cubicin`      `cubicout`      `cubicinout`
  `quartin`      `quartout`      `quartinout`
  `quintin`      `quintout`      `quintinout`
  `expoin`       `expoout`       `expoinout`
  `sinein`       `sineout`       `sineinout`
  `circin`       `circout`       `circinout`
  `backin`       `backout`       `backinout`
  `elasticin`    `elasticout`    `elasticinout`

The default easing type is `quadout`. Examples of the different easing types
can be [found here](http://easings.net/).


#### :delay(time)
The amount of time flux should wait before starting the tween; `time` should be
a number of seconds. The default delay time is `0`.

#### :onstart(fn)
Sets the function `fn` to be called when the tween starts (once the delay has
finished). `:onstart()` can be called multiple times to add more than one
function.

#### :onupdate(fn)
Sets the function `fn` to be called each frame the tween updates a value.
`onupdate()` can be called multiple times to add more than one function.

#### :oncomplete(fn)
Sets the function `fn` to be called once the tween has finished and reached its
destination values. `oncomplete()` can be called multiple times to add more
than one function.

#### :after([obj,] time, vars)
Creates and returns a new tween and chains it to the end of the existing tween; the chained
tween will be called after the original one has finished. Any additional
chained function used after `:after()` will effect the chained tween. There is
no limit to how many times `:after()` can be used in a chain, allowing the
creation of long tween sequences. If `obj` is not specified the `obj` argument
from the original tween is used.
```lua
-- Tweens t.x to 10 over 2 seconds, then to 20 over 1 second
flux.to(t, 2, { x = 10 }):after(t, 1, { x = 20 })
```

### Stopping a tween
If you want the ability to stop a tween before it has finished, the tween
should be assigned to a variable when it is created.
```lua
local tween = flux.to(x, 2, { y = 20 }):delay(1)
```
The tween can then be stopped at any point by calling its `:stop()` method.
```lua
tween:stop()
```
This will cause the tween to immediatly be removed from its parent group and
will leave its tweened variables at their current values. The tween's
`oncomplete()` callback is not called.

### Groups
flux provides the ability to create tween groups; these are objects
which can have tweens added to them, and who are in charge of updating and
handling their contained tweens. A group is created by calling the
`flux.group()` function.
```lua
group = flux.group()
```
Once a group is created it acts independently of the `flux` object, and must
be updated each frame using its own update method.
```lua
group:update(deltatime)
```
To add a tween to a group, the group's `to()` method should be used.
```lua
group:to(t, 3, { x = 10, y = 20 })
```
A good example of where groups are useful is for games where you may have a set
of tweens which effect objects in the game world and which you want to pause
when the game is paused.  A group's tweens can be paused by simply neglecting
to call its `update()` method; when a group is destroyed its tweens are also
destroyed.
